    "**NOTE** Instead of Steps 2-4 I first just tried the simple command git clone https://github.com/achaiallah-hub/Wiki4CES.git This works, but it stores the .py scripts inside a repo directory folder called Wiki4CES, and I think this causes problems when trying to use the spiders later. Steps 2-4 are a work-around: this way the python scripts are directly within the \"spiders\" directory without being inside another directory. In order to do steps 2-4 an **ssh-key** needs to be set up. "
