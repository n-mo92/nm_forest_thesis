My adapted spiders (with notes on what was changed) are available in this repo in [wikiloc_scrapy/wikiloc_scrapy/spiders/](wikiloc_scrapy/wikiloc_scrapy/spiders/) I have also recorded change notes in the steps of this script.\n",

After a search for the components on the main Bremen page and then for one city (for example: https://www.wikiloc.com/trails/outdoor/germany/bremen/alte-neustadt) I made a couple changed to the xpaths in extract_link.py (see comments in script). I also made some changes to the pagination handling (see comments in script). ALSO, since the URLs saved initially were just the back half of the URL, without the beginning (eg. /cycling-trails/bremen-achim-18077390) I adjusted the code to add the beginning part as well. This ended up being required for the other spiders to work properly. \n",

    "#### Step 1 - ADDITION: extract_link_large.py\n",
    "\n",
    "For large/popular states like Bavaria and Nordrhein-Westfalen, I ran into problems where many trails links were missing after the link extraction. These were quite large amounts compared to small amounts missing for other regions - for example, for Bavaria I was expecting around 80,000 trails but only got ~10,000. I found out this is because Wikiloc uses a pagination cap of 1000 pages - so for especially popular activites, even if there were more than 1000 pages worth of trails, the URLS like https://www.wikiloc.com/trails/hiking/germany/bavaria?page=1001 simply don't work. Given that there are 10 trails per page, this means a maximum of 10,000 trails can be accessed through the 1000 pages. For most regions/activity combinations this is not a problem, but for hiking trails in Bavaria (for example), there are about 32,000 trails, meaning 22,000 trails are missed with this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this issue I created another scraper for handling large regions specifically. Instead of supplying a URL to the region and filtering all trails by activity, this approach uses a directory of places within a region, accessing each in turn. For each place within a region, the scraper checks whether further filtering is possible by activity. If available it filters the trails for the place by activity, and if not it extracts the trails directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** It seems like the best way is to run both the extract_link.py and the extract_link_large.py - this seems to cover all bases and gets the most links. This could be because not all trails are linked to place beyond simply the region, and so the second script might not get everything either. Just make sure to remove duplicates AFTER merging the lists."

    "Required steps:\n",
    "1. Filter to only include trails which intersect with Natura 2000 areas. \n",
    "2. Filter for forests - here I can calculate the zonal statistics using the buffered trail geometries (filtered to only those which intersect with Natura sites) with the consensus map. I can then calculate the max class for each trail geometry and only include the trails which have a max class of 3, 4, 5, or 6 (ie. classes where at least half of the forest definitions agree on forest presence). In other words, if the max class of a trail is a non-forest class (0,1,2), then I remove it from the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE:\n",
    "For **RQ3** I found that, with all the filters applied in this script, there are very few remaining trails for the comparison between class 3 and 6. I decided to try to still demonstrate the process (of comparing class 3 and 6), but with the adjustment to consider all 2018 trails in forest areas - i.e. not just the ones intersecting with Natura sites. SO: I created an alternative step to include a column in the shapefile indicating whether the trail intersects with Natura or not - this can be used as a filter later for RQ2 (which only uses Natura trails) but also means that I have the trail text ready for non-Natura areas as well (for RQ3)."
