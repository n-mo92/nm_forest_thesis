    "scrapy spiders are provided by Chai-Allah et al, 2023 through their GitHub repo: [Wiki4CES](https://github.com/achaiallah-hub/Wiki4CES)\n",
    "\n",
    "From what I understand, the spiders provided in the Wiki4CES repo do the following:\n",
    "1. **extract_link.py** Extracts the URLS for all the trails. You give it a starting region (an intital URL) and it goes through each city/town in that region and extracts all the trail links (URLS) in the cities listing. This spider neeeds to be run first to get the URLS for steps 2 and 3. \n",
    "2. **wikiloc_track.py** Scrapes the trail details like track name, difficulty, distance, author, views and description. It loads the trail URLs from a file called link.csv (presumably created in step 1)\n",
    "3. **wikiloc_image.py** Scrapes image data from the trail pages, including URL, track name, user name, date, and location (latitude & longitude). It reads the trail pages from a file called link.csv (presumably created in step 1)\n",
    "4. **download_image.py** Downloads images from the URLS in a csv file called wikiloc_image.csv (presumably this would be created from step 3). Not needed for my work, so I have removed this file\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** For some reason, running one spider seems to try to run all the spiders at once, and you end up getting error messages saying certain files don't exist (which makes sense as these files need to be created by certain spiders first). I tried looking for the solution for this, but for now I've just commented out the code within the other spiders. UPDATE: It seems to be okay once the errors have been resolved (it doesn't actually run the other spiders but seem to check for the correct files and the code being valid?), so I'm leaving finished scripts uncommented as I correct them."

I also made some changes to the pagination handling (see comments in script). ALSO, since the URLs saved initially were just the back half of the URL, without the beginning (eg. /cycling-trails/bremen-achim-18077390) I adjusted the code to add the beginning part as well.
